# Code Review: Model Selection Support Feature

**Reviewed Commits**: 9eae0f7–613e7bb (model selection feature + config manager fixes)

## Summary
**PASS with CONCERNS**

The model selection feature is well-architected with comprehensive tests and proper precedence handling (flag → config → template → SDK default). Code quality is generally strong with good error handling and defensive programming. However, there is **code duplication in model resolution** across two commands, and **one file exceeds the 300-line limit**. These concerns are fixable without significant refactoring.

---

## Findings

### [FAIL] File Size Violation
**File**: `src/orchestration/cli/commands/review.py` (369 lines)

The module exceeds the 300-line limit specified in CLAUDE.md (§ Code Structure). At 369 lines, it is 69 lines over the target. Consider splitting into a submodule structure:
- Keep command definitions and CLI parsing in `review.py`
- Move shared logic (`_resolve_cwd()`, `_resolve_model()`, `_resolve_verbosity()`, `_resolve_rules_content()`) to `src/orchestration/cli/commands/review_helpers.py`
- Move display functions (`_display_terminal()`, `_display_json()`, `_write_file()`) to `src/orchestration/review/display.py`

This would bring `review.py` to ~220 lines and improve testability.

---

### [FAIL] Code Duplication: Model Resolution
**Files**:
- `src/orchestration/cli/commands/review.py:165–176` (`_resolve_model()`)
- `src/orchestration/cli/commands/spawn.py:19–24` (`_resolve_spawn_model()`)

Two nearly identical functions implement model resolution. This violates the DRY principle and creates maintenance burden. **Recommended fix**:

Create a shared utility in `src/orchestration/cli/commands/common.py`:
```python
def resolve_model_with_template(
    flag: str | None,
    template: ReviewTemplate | None = None
) -> str | None:
    """Resolve model: CLI flag → config → template → None."""
    if flag is not None:
        return flag
    config_val = get_config("default_model")
    if isinstance(config_val, str):
        return config_val
    if template is not None and template.model is not None:
        return template.model
    return None

def resolve_model(flag: str | None) -> str | None:
    """Resolve model: CLI flag → config → None."""
    if flag is not None:
        return flag
    config_val = get_config("default_model")
    return config_val if isinstance(config_val, str) else None
```

Both commands can import and use the appropriate version.

---

### [PASS] Error Handling & Validation
**Files**: `src/orchestration/config/manager.py`, `src/orchestration/review/runner.py`

Strong explicit error handling throughout:
- `_coerce_value()` raises `ValueError` for unsupported types (not silent fallback) ✓
- Unknown config keys logged as warnings (catches typos) ✓
- Rate limit detection and retry logic with exponential delay ✓
- Specific exception catching (no bare `except:`) ✓

The defensive `isinstance()` checks (e.g., review.py:139, 149, 172) are appropriate for config values since TOML types are flexible.

---

### [PASS] Type Safety
**Files**: All Python files reviewed

Proper adherence to Python guidelines:
- Union types use `|` syntax: `str | None` (not `Optional[str]`) ✓
- `from __future__ import annotations` present ✓
- Type hints on all function signatures ✓
- Use of `StrEnum` for constants (models.py:10–24) ✓
- Dataclass for DTOs (models.py:31–51) ✓

---

### [PASS] Testing Coverage
**File**: `tests/review/test_model_resolution.py`

Comprehensive test coverage for model resolution precedence:
- All four precedence levels tested (`_resolve_model()` tests lines 57–86)
- CLI flag integration tests for all three commands (arch, tasks, code) ✓
- Edge cases covered (all absent, no template, template fallback) ✓
- Test organization is clean with fixtures and parameterization ✓

Integration in `test_runner.py` validates end-to-end model passing (lines 140–219):
- Explicit model passed to options
- Template model as fallback
- Explicit model overrides template
- Model stored in result

---

### [PASS] Constants & Configuration
**File**: `src/orchestration/config/keys.py`

Excellent declarative config system:
- All config keys defined in `CONFIG_KEYS` dict with metadata
- Types, defaults, and descriptions centralized ✓
- New `default_model` key properly declared (lines 37–42)
- `get_default()` function with proper KeyError on unknown keys ✓

---

### [PASS] Model Resolution Logic
**File**: `src/orchestration/cli/commands/review.py:165–176`

The precedence chain (flag → config → template → None) is:
1. **Clear and documented** in docstring ✓
2. **Correct and complete** (all three sources checked in order) ✓
3. **Defensive** (isinstance checks prevent type mismatches) ✓
4. **Used consistently** across three review commands ✓

---

### [PASS] Display & Output
**File**: `src/orchestration/cli/commands/review.py:50–127`

Terminal output properly displays model:
- Lines 82–84: Model shown in header when present ✓
- JSON output includes model field (line 70) ✓
- Verbosity levels respected ✓
- Rich formatting for readability ✓

---

### [PASS] Semantic Naming
All files reviewed follow semantic naming conventions:
- Variable names: `resolved_model`, `resolved_cwd`, `config_val` (clear intent) ✓
- Function names: `_resolve_model()`, `_coerce_value()`, `parse_review_output()` (descriptive verbs) ✓
- Command names: `arch`, `tasks`, `code`, `list` (clear intent) ✓

---

### [CONCERN] Import Organization
**File**: `src/orchestration/cli/commands/review.py:1–23`

Imports are correct but could be tightened:
- Standard lib: `asyncio`, `json`, `logging` ✓
- Third party: `typer`, `rich` ✓
- Local: `orchestration.*` ✓

However, `logging` is imported (line 1-8) but never used in the file. Consider removing if not needed in the future, or verify it's used elsewhere.

---

### [PASS] Pathway & File Operations
All file operations use `pathlib.Path`:
- `manager.py:23`: `Path(cwd).resolve()` ✓
- `manager.py:18`: `Path.home()` ✓
- `review.py:158`: `Path(rules_path)` ✓

No legacy `os.path` operations detected. ✓

---

## Summary of Recommendations

### Critical (Fix Before Merge)
1. **Refactor duplication**: Consolidate `_resolve_model()` and `_resolve_spawn_model()` into shared utilities
2. **Reduce file size**: Split `review.py` into command handlers + helper modules (target ≤250 lines)

### Quality (Suggest)
1. Check if `logging` import in review.py is needed; remove if not
2. Consider adding type stub or improving docstrings for `_execute_review()` if it's public API

### No Action Needed
- Error handling is solid ✓
- Type safety is strong ✓
- Test coverage is comprehensive ✓
- Configuration system is well-designed ✓
- Constants properly declared ✓

---

## Exit Criteria
✓ No security issues detected
✓ No silent fallback values detected
✓ No hard-coded magic numbers (constants properly declared)
✗ Code duplication exists (minor, fixable)
✗ One file exceeds size limit (minor, fixable)
✓ Tests comprehensive and passing
✓ Follows Python 3.12+ conventions
✓ Type hints complete

**Verdict**: PASS with minor refactoring recommended before merge.
